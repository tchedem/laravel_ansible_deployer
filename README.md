### Laravel Ansible Deployer

A full Laravel deployment solution built with Ansible, bootstraped-from [ansible-quick-starter](https://github.com/tchedem/ansible-quick-starter).

`playbooks/` contain main Ansible playbooks for provisioning and deployment
`roles/` Modular roles for different parts of the stack
`vagrant/` Local test environment (Vagrant + VirtualBox). (NB: You can use any Hypervisor)
`reference/` *have some a manual process ofdeployment of the solution! It's no-more updated! But I left it to share the importance of doing things by our own at least once!*

### Roles Overview

Each role is a building block of the deployment process:

- `common` : updates system packages, installs common utilities (git, curl, unzip, etc.)
- `php8.1 or php8.2` : installed any version of php with required extensions on your hosts
- `composer` installed the mytic PHP package manager
- `nginx` installed the NGINX webserver/proxy used to serve content
- `mariadb` installed a relationnal database to store and persist our apps data
